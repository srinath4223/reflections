How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
     If I have access to old versions of the file I can see the progress I made
and I can impeove gradually 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
  Pros
    If the commits are done logically it will allow us to have meanigful commitsand tracing the flow pf projrct woulf be succesfull.
  Cons
    obvious We may forget to commit.
    opp of the above
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
   Since I can checkout any instan of the repostory I know that even if i make changes I have acccess to unchanged versions.
